### MSF-ArchInstaller

###### The purpose of this script is simplifying the process of installing Metasploit Framework on Arch Linux, directly from git. 

The script will :
  
* check is the system is up to date and install dependencies
  
and then download, configure and install:
  
* ruby using RVM
  
* nmap from SVN
  
* Metasploit Framework from Git
  
* Postgresql
  
* Armitage
  
The whole idea came up to me when I saw http://www.darkoperator.com/installing-metasploit-in-ubunt/ and realized that we can't wait everything from some persons. We have to do our part too. Congrats to DarkOperator for his great work. The main idea and some parts of the code are taken from him.
